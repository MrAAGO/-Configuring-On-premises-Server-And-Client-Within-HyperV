Here are the basic steps for configuring an on-premises Windows Server 2019 and client Windows PCs and Macs:

Install Windows Server 2019: Install the Windows Server 2019 operating system on the server hardware. This will include configuring the server's network settings and joining it to the domain.

Create and Configure Active Directory: Create and configure the Active Directory domain services on the server. This will include creating user and group accounts, as well as setting up organizational units (OUs) to manage the accounts.

Configure File and Print Services: Configure the server to provide file and print services to the clients. This will include setting up shared folders and printers, as well as configuring permissions and access controls.

Configure Remote Access: Configure the server to allow remote access to the clients. This will include setting up Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.

Configure Windows Clients: Configure the Windows clients to connect to the server. This will include joining the clients to the domain, installing necessary software, and configuring network settings.

Configure Mac Clients: Configure the Mac clients to connect to the server. This will include installing necessary software, such as the Microsoft Remote Desktop client, and configuring network settings.

Backup and Disaster Recovery Configuration: It's important to configure the server's backup and disaster recovery settings, such as setting up backup schedules and creating recovery plans, to ensure that the data is safe and can be recovered in case of any issues.

Software and Security Update Configuration: Schedule regular software and security updates to ensure that the server and clients are up to date and secure.

Create Group Policies: Create and configure group policies to manage settings and configurations on the clients. This will include setting up policies for software installations, network settings, and security settings.

Monitor and Audit: Set up monitoring and auditing on the server to track user activity, resource usage, and security events. This will include setting up event logs, performance counters, and security alerts.

Install Additional Services: Install additional services on the server such as DNS, DHCP, and IIS.

Remote management: Configure the server to be remotely manageable using tools like Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)

Management of Mac clients: Depending on the number of Mac clients, it may be useful to configure a Mac management solution, such as Apple Remote Desktop or JAMF Pro, to manage the clients.
